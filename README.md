#### Description:

Your financial expense manager. Wallet is a simple and interactive tracker that provides an easy-to-use interface to manage your expenses, save daily budgets, view summary of your expenditures, delete expenses, and send expense reports to your preferred email.

#### Main Features:

1. Add Expense: Effortlessly manage expense entries, including customizable names, amounts, and categories.
2. Save Expenses: Save all your entries to a CSV file to store and track your long-term expenditure trends.
3. Summarize Expenses: Review a summary of your expenditures with a detailed breakdown, revealing your spending habits.
4. Delete Expense: This allows the user to delete a contact by providing the expense's name.
5. Send report to email: Receive a generated PDF report of your monthly expenses that can be sent to your preferred email.
6. View All Expenses: A list of all the entered expenses per category.

#### Usage
1. Run the program by executing <kbd>python project.py</kbd>
3. Install the required dependencies using pip <kbd>pip install -r requirements.txt</kbd>
4. Test the program python script test_project.py with pytest by running <kbd>pytest test_project.py</kbd>
5. Note: For the option 5. Send expense report to email
    "from confidential import password " is a module where the password of the email used is being stored
    to be able to use this option you have to replace it with yours. You also have to use/create your own email
    that is gonna be used to send email. When running this code you are gonna face an ImportError if these conditions aren't being met but you can use the program by commenting that line     out. All the other options will be available to you except option 5.
6. Please do not forget to save expenses after every change e.g. after deleting an expense or adding an expense. This helps with making sure the CSV file is up-to-date.
7. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ErinAurelie/Wallet.git
